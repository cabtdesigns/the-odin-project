<p>I’m sure everyone has his own favorite go-to lasagna recipe, but I’d just like to offer that this really is The Best Lasagna Ever. Growing up, my mom and her friends used to make it for potlucks and gatherings, and part of its appeal is that the ingredients used are totally basic; you don’t have to hunt down fresh basil or buffalo mozzarella or Parmigiano-Reggiano or handmade sausage from an Italian mama in old Napoli.

    I’ve made this lasagna for various categories of humans since my mom first scribbled it down for me: men, women, democrats, republicans, scholars, and foreign dignitaries.

So let’s get started! </p>
